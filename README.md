# runcons

This is a collection of run control files (rc files) for various linux/unix
like operating systems with GNU utilities or something similar.  The full
meaning of rc is apparently debatable, see:  
http://askubuntu.com/questions/23482/what-does-rc-in-bashrc-nanorc-stand-for.
I'll go with 'run controls' or runcons as the files here are mostly for run
configuration/control of other programs  such as bash, vi and conda.
