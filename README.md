# runcons

This is a collection of run control files (rc files) for various linux/un*x like operating systems with GNU
utiltites or something similar.  The full meaning of rc is apparently debateable; see:  
http://askubuntu.com/questions/23482/what-does-rc-in-bashrc-nanorc-stand-for.  I'll go with 'run controls' or runcons
as the files here are mostly for run configuration/control of other programs such as bash and conda.
